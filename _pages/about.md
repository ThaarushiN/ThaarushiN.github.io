Hello, I’m Tharushi Herath, a Data Science graduate currently working as a Trainee AI Developer. I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between data, engineering, and real-world impact.

I strongly believe in the saying, “If it’s not documented, you didn’t build it.” I love sharing what I've built and learned and that’s exactly what this portfolio is for: to grow, reflect, and connect with others who are as excited about technology as I am.

Professionally, I’ve worked on projects that range from LLM-based document analysis and chatbot development to real-time defect detection systems using computer vision and IoT-based monitoring devices. My experience spans the full stack of AI engineering , from data pipelines and model development to FastAPI deployment and Azure integration.

My interests lie in Machine Learning, AIoT/Edge AI, and AI development. I first became fascinated by AI when I tried out Midjourney soon after it launched. I was fascinated by the fact that a group of people created that, something that seemed like magic at the time. Since then, I’ve been exploring how to make data science more practical, accessible, and creative.

In short, I’m an engineer who learns by building, documents by sharing, and aspires to contribute to a world where intelligent systems make life easier and simpler.
