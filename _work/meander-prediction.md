Developed a **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** to predict **river meander migration** using time-series satellite imagery.

**Technical Approach:**
- Combined **CNN** and **XGBoost** models with environmental features such as leaf area index and surface runoff.  
- Applied **SMOTE** and custom loss weighting to address class imbalance.  
- Integrated **Explainable AI** (saliency maps, variable importance) to visualize model behavior.

**Outcome:**  
Supported civil engineers and environmental planners by providing accurate, explainable forecasts for safer infrastructure development.
