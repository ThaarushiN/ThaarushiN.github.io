Built an **IoT-driven environmental monitoring device** using **MQ2** and **DHT22 sensors** to detect harmful gases and track temperature/humidity.

**Key Features:**
- Data streamed to **Azure IoT Hub** for real-time processing.  
- Automated alert generation via **Microsoft Power Automate** when unsafe levels were detected.  
- Dashboard for visualizing live readings and trends.

**Outcome:**  
Improved real-time safety monitoring in indoor environments through cloud-connected automation.
