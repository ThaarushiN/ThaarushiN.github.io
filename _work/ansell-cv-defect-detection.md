At **Ansell Lanka**, I contributed to the development and testing of a **real-time defect detection system** for medical glove packaging lines using **YOLO-based object detection**.

**Key Achievements:**
- Automated manual inspection by detecting glove defects and label inconsistencies.  
- Improved model accuracy through **data augmentation and synthetic image generation**.  
- Designed **computer vision pipelines** for defect detection and text validation using **OpenCV** and **Tesseract OCR**.  

**Impact:**  
Reduced inspection time and improved quality assurance efficiency, enabling early anomaly detection in production workflows.
