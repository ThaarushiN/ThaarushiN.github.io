Developed a **machine learning web app** to predict water potability based on chemical and physical properties.

**Stack:**
- **Model:** Logistic Regression  
- **Backend:** Flask API  
- **Frontend:** React interface  

**Highlights:**
- Used features like pH, hardness, and conductivity for prediction.  
- Achieved a high classification accuracy while reducing false postives.  
- Created a seamless interface enabling instant safety checks.

**Outcome:**  
Allowed non-technical users to easily assess water safety through an intuitive ML-powered web tool.
